Graph algorithms are a set of instructions that traverse (visits the nodes of a) graph.

Some algorithms are used to find specific nodes, or the path between two given nodes.

Graphs are very useful data structures which can be used to model various problems. These algorithms have direct applications on Social Networking sites, State Machine modeling and many more.

Some of the most common graph algorithms are:
1. Breadth First Search (BFS)
2. Depth First Search (DFS)
3. Dijkstra
4. Floyd Warshall Algorithm
