    -Heaps and priority queues
    -Heaps resemble a complete binary tree
    -Every single level is full except for the last one
    -Nodes need to be pushed to the left
    -There's two variations on the heap - the min heap & the max heap
    -The max heap has the idea that at each node, each child node value is smaller
    -Every single child is smaller
    -Root node is the greatest value
    -Min heap is the reverse of the rule, it's the smallest value at the root
